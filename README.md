BLACKJACK: A simple game of Blackjack that can be played on the command line. Players can hit, stand, double down or all in on their hand. Unfortunately, splitting is not supported. Accommodates up to 10 players playing simultaneously against the house, but this limit can be increased.

This is code I threw together in a few days as practice. Even though it works, please do not use it for any actual purposes lest it shits itself.
